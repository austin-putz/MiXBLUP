# MiXBLUP Examples

Documentation and examples for MiXBLUP Software using Mrode's 4th Edition. 

Please get a copy of Mrode's book, here is link to [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Models-Prediction-Genetic-Animals/dp/1800620489/ref=sr_1_1?crid=33JGPUS52K1UE&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.cgsmL0Fr1_dsmNh9rPNjhw.vmcwro4QogCZwkZPHJzZpKjGIsw_HCn-FWgd3NrPh_M&dib_tag=se&keywords=mrode+4th+edition+linear+models&qid=1723557770&sprefix=mrode+4th+edition+linear+models%2Caps%2C79&sr=8-1). 

Notes on MiXBLUP:

* Programmed between Wageningen University (Netherlands) and Finland (LUKE)
* Maintained by [Dr. Jan ten Napel](https://www.wur.nl/en/persons/jan-ten-napel-1.htm) and [Dr. Jerermie Vandenplas](https://research.wur.nl/en/persons/jeremie-vandenplas) for the most part. 
* One of the only softwares in the world that can handle large-scale genetic evaluations (other is [BLUPF90](https://nce.ads.uga.edu/wiki/doku.php?id=start))
* Allows single-step GBLUP (ssGBLUP) analyses and single-step ridge-regresssion (ssRRBLUP) based on Rohan Fernando's work

The have a lengthy manual but the documentation was a little difficult to understand and I think examples are far better to learn software with than written descriptions.

# vim syntax highlighting for MiXBLUP

Here is an install file and both files you need for syntax highlighting with vim using MiXBLUP software. 

Of course, you need a MacOS or Linux system for these to work with vim (No WINDOWS).

Download all 3 files above: `install_mixblup_vim.sh`, `mix.vim`, `mix.vim_ftdetect`. 

Make sure the shell script is an executable with:

```bash
chmod 775 install_mixblup_vim.sh
```

If you name your MiXBLUP instruction file `ctl.mix` you can use the following command to turn on syntax highlighting.

See some of my Mrode examples in the home directory. 

```bash
vim ctl.mix
:set syntax=mix
```
